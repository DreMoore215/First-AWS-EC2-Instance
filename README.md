# First-AWS-EC2-Instance
Learning AWS by launching and managing my first EC2 instance.
# AWS EC2 Lab – My First Cloud Server 

## What I Did
- Launched my first **AWS EC2 instance**
- Learned that an EC2 instance = a virtual server running in the cloud
- Explored the AWS Management Console and basic settings
- Understood instance types, public IPs, key pairs, and security groups

## Next Steps
- Learn how to connect via SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows)
- Practice installing a web server (like Nginx or Apache)
- Experiment with S3 or IAM

## What I Learned
> “Launching an instance means creating a computer in the cloud that I can access and control remotely.”
